This README.md file can play the role of a TLDR (which stands for Too Long, Didn't Read) to the notebook file. I will summit my results and the model used to get it. 

## Datset

The dataset can ben found in the WineQuality.csv file or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/wine-quality-data-combined?resource=download).

## Red or White ? 
 
In this section on the notebook, we asked ourselves if the wine was red or whute depending on the different factors. We used Random Forest.
We discovered that some variables had a bigger impact on the type of wine (like sulfur dioxide for example). 

## Which quality ?

Wine quality can be divided into 7 groups (from 3 to 9 included). 
In the final predictions, the only differences we had compared to the real quality was about 1 group (for example, we predict a wine to be a 5, but in reality it was a 6). We used Random Forest.
